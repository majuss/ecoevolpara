# Acquire software like Office and Photoshop

## Step 0: Think about whether you really need non-free sofware

There are alternatives. Libreoffice instead of M$ office (or what about LaTeX or Markdown?), the gimp instead of photoshop, inkscape instead of illustrator etc... If you are a member of the Heitlinger lab you should consider those options.

## Step 1: Write an E-Mail to Robert Arndt

Write an E-Mail to [Robert Arndt] he is the official IT-respondant for our institute. Ask him about the smb-share (smb is a network protocoll) of the molecular parasitology and how to access it. He will create a domain account for you and will describe further steps.

## Step 2: Connect to the share using macOS

After you gain access to that share activate the Finder and hit the key-combo `CMD+K`. A small windows will pop up. Enter the following into the window and replace $USERNAME with your CMS-username:
`smb://biologie;bio_$USERNAME:passwort@hubio34c.user.hu-berlin.de/BioPro2/`. Hit enter, now enter your password. You now have a connection to the smb-share.
