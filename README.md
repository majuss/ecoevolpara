# ecoevolpara

This is the documentation of the working group ***ecology and evolution of molecular Parasite-host
interactions*** which is lead by [**Prof. Dr. Emanuel Heitlinger**]. 

If you're new and don't know what to read head over to the chapter [**Getting started in the Heitlinger group**]. Or if you're sitting in front of the working computer and don't know how to handle Linux [see this chapter].

If you want to add something to the documentation head over to the [**Github-repository**], there are also little bottons for this on every page here. Then you can ask the admin if you can get permissions to contribute directly inside of your browser, or you *fork* the repo and start to contribute by sending a [*pull-request*].
